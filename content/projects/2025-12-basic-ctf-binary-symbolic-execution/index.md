title: "Reverse Engineering and Symbolic Execution with Ghidra and angr for CTF Binary Analysis"
summary: "Analyzed 32-bit Linux CTF binaries using Ghidra, GDB, and angr to reverse-engineer program logic, identify key execution paths, and recover hidden flags through symbolic execution."
description: "A software security project focused on Capture-The-Flag (CTF)–style binary analysis. This project used Ghidra for disassembly, GDB for low-level debugging, and angr for symbolic execution to explore program states, locate critical addresses, and extract embedded flags. Includes techniques for interpreting control flow, analyzing stack and memory layouts, and constructing valid symbolic inputs."

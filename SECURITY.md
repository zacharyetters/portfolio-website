# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to report a security vulnerability in this project. Security is important to me. Please follow the guidelines below so I can address reports promptly and responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately using GitHub's confidential vulnerability reporting for this repository. The recommended way is to open a report via the repository's Security → "Report a vulnerability" form on GitHub:

- Report a vulnerability (confidential): [Open a private report](https://github.com/zacharyetters/portfolio-website/security/advisories/new)
- GitHub docs: [Reporting a vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory)

When filing a report, include:

- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (minimal repro if possible)
- The affected version(s) and files
- Any suggested mitigations or fixes, if available
- Hugo version (run `hugo version` and include the output)

If you need to share sensitive PoC code or data, attach it to the GitHub report as an encrypted file, or provide a link to a private Gist or other secure location. Please do not publicly disclose PoC details.

## Response and Timeline

I will acknowledge receipt of your report within 14 business days. My goal is to:

- Triage and confirm the issue within 30 business days
- Provide a remediation plan or patch within 90–180 days, depending on severity, complexity, and my availability as this is a personal project

These timelines are targets, not guarantees. I may take longer depending on availability; if more time is required I will attempt to provide status updates and an estimated timeline.

## Scope

The policy applies to the code in this repository and to deployed/hosted versions of the site (this project uses rolling updates rather than formal versioned releases).

- Production site: [zacharyetters.com](https://zacharyetters.com/)

It does not cover vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies or external services; please report those to the respective maintainers.

## Disclosure Policy

I follow coordinated disclosure: please do not publicly disclose the issue until a fix is available or we agree on a disclosure timeline. Once a fix is available, I will publish an advisory with credit (if desired) and relevant details.
